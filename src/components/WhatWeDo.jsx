                1000 Cyber Drops will be dropping on Ethereum in March 2022.
                Each and every Cyber Drop is uniquely hand crafted. This is just
                the beginning of our journey. Owning a Cyber Drop will unlock
                monthly airdrops and future governance rights in addition to our
                revolutionary algorithm. We strive to always bring innovation
                and keep BUILDing. Cyber Drops is a community driven project and
                always will be that way. Thatâ€™s our promise.
